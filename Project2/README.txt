For my second project in IT3038c I decided to create a script that determines zodiac compatibility.

This project explored the use of Python Dictionaries instead of many if/elif/else statements.  I had not explored using Python dictionaries before and found it to be the easiest way to make a script like this run/make sense.

The idea for this project was not taken off the internet.  I tried many different things before selecting this project, including a daily weather forecast, but found that I did not like any of the partial projects very much.  This one felt new and fun.

The explanations of zodiac compatibility came from this website: https://thoughtcatalog.com/kirsten-corley/2017/11/ranking-all-144-zodiac-couples-by-which-ones-end-up-the-happiest/

There are no prerequisites needed to runt his script.  Just navigate to the folder it is saved in and run 
  python3 ZodiacComp.py
  
Thank you for reading, please enjoy the script!
