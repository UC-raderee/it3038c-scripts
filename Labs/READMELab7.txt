I used the Emoji module for this lab.

I installed Emoji by typing

git clone https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji.git

cd emoji

sudo python3 setup.py install

You can then run the script by navigating back to the directory it is installed in and typing python3 Lab7.py

The script will tell you what to do from there
