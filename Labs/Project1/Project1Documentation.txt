For my first project, I created a Python script to play MadLibs with a computer.

You'll run this script by navigating to the file it is held within on your
system, then typing:

python3 RaderProject1.py

Once you've started the script you will be prompted to fill in a list of nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc., and once finished will be given a story with your
chosen words put into their logical (or illogical, which is kind of the point) 
place.  You will then laugh at my fun game and fun story because I am fun.

The inspiration for this project was found at the following location:

I got the genral idea from this page, but changed the story and many of the
lines to make it run smoother and more unique to myself.  The story used was
found at the following link, written by Brain Bunny.

Have fun and thanks for playing my Mad Libs game!
